# Retention-prediction
The project involves the development of a machine learning pipeline utilizing the CatBoostClassifier algorithm. The initial phase includes the importation of essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. Subsequently, the script loads and visualizes the training data, conducts data preprocessing, analyzes correlations, explores categorical variables, and examines monthly retention rate trends. The implementation then establishes a robust data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline, extending these processes to the test dataset. Central to the project is the training of a CatBoostClassifier on the prepared data, incorporating cross-validation and performance assessment on a validation set. Further steps involve generating predictions on the test data and creating a submission CSV. The significance of features in the trained model is depicted through a bar chart, while the model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix heatmap and a learning curve plot. The project presents a systematic approach encompassing data exploration, preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization, offering a comprehensive guide to building and assessing a machine learning model for retention prediction.
